Unit Testing
The lib directory will contain the source code that solves the problem. The bin
directory should contain the code that 'runs' your code. Often this is a simple
command line shell that then invokes the code you have created in the lib 
directory. The test directory will contain the unit tests that will exercise
and verify the code you created in lib.
